# Whiskey Drop Milestone Project

### Purpose
This project is intended to create a working understanding of Bootstrap Framework and how its components can speed up your development of webpages.

#### Challenges

I have zero background knowledge in coding so each of the lessons so far in HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap have essentially been learning a new language for me and the small nuances that comes with it.
I have found that by simply not paying enough attention to my code structure in the beginning can create layout nightmares at a later stage when looking at the preview, then wasting valuable time searching for where the issue is in my code to try fix something that is actually functioning perfectly as entered, but not displaying in the position I want it to be in!
Bootstrap has an invaluable library of components that can be copied and edited to suit your purpose in your own code and the Challenge to add your own Table was a brilliant way to get me to start looking more in-depth into the Bootstrap database.

Another hilarious lesson was learning my laptop screen would be considered a Medium size by HTML as I was just about tearing my hair out trying to figure out why some of my code wasnt working no matter i was viewing at fullscreen!
