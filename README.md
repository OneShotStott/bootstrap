# Whiskey Drop Milestone Project

### Purpose
This project is intended to create a working understanding of Bootstrap Framework and how its components can speed up your development of webpages.

#### Challenges

I have zero background knowledge in coding so each of the lessons so far in HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap have essentially been learning a new language for me and the small nuances that comes with it.
I have found that by simply not paying enough attention to my code structure in the beginning can create layout nightmares at a later stage when looking at the preview, then wasting valuable time searching for where the issue is in my code to try fix something that is actually functioning perfectly as entered, but not displaying in the position I want it to be in!
Bootstrap has an invaluable library of components that can be copied and edited to suit your purpose in your own code and the Challenge to add your own Table was a brilliant way to get me to start looking more in-depth into the Bootstrap database.

Another hilarious lesson was learning my laptop screen would be considered a Medium size by HTML as I was just about tearing my hair out trying to figure out why some of my code wasnt working no matter i was viewing at fullscreen!

The styling options available to you with Bootstrap are immense and definitely seem to be a faster route than using just CSS.

While Matt does a great job of explaining what he is doing in these lessons, I dont actually have a clue where or how I am supposed to know all these new code terms and am actually feeling incredibly overwhelmed, up until now it has been a logical process to follow what is happening and code it myself after watching these lessons, but this entire lesson I felt that all I am actually doing is typing out exactly what Matt is without actually knowing what I am doing, I comprehend what he means as he goes through it in the videos but it's all new components not taught before and it feels quite rushed, hopefully there is more focus on it later, currently not feeling at all confident for my Milestone Project.
I do however, see the benefits of Bootstrap and obviously only intense practice will make this understandable.
